### TeamQuery

TeamQuery is a web application aimed to encourage transparency and collaboration within teams.

This software was written using Ruby on Rails and was met with a receptive market after only two weeks of development.

The primary goal of this project was to help teach Liatrio DevOps bootcampers about CICD; this occured through the use of Jenkins and agile software development tactics.

### Installation

In order to run TeamQuery, Ruby and Ruby on Rails will need to be installed on Centos or Redhat Linux.

Ruby          ~ 2.4.1
Ruby on Rails ~ 4.2.0
git           ~ latest

Once these dependencies have been installed, a few scripts will need to be modified to fit your environment. These scripts are startdev, startprod, status and stop. The only modifications that will need to be made to run these scripts are:

* directories must be upated to match wherever you place the repository.
* 'centos' needs to be changed to whatever user you want to run the server as.

If you are familiar with or would like to use a Vagrant development environment, go ahead and get the VM below!
